# getonboard
A gamified learning experience where explorers are onboarded into web3 metaverse through a decentralised storytelling process. Using TheGraph, Onboard queries on-chain activity and assigns a score to various smart contract interactions. If a user has completed the task, they gain XP and badges. Eventually, Onboard will be curated entirely by the community to determine what the best possible path to get Onboard.

The benefits of Onboard is two-fold: 1) acquisition for dApps for users to understand how to use their advanced smart contracts and 2) guide the user from beginner-friendly smart contracts to more advanced smart contracts.

Onboard integrates with 3box so users can write their XP to their 3box profiles. Third-party dApps can use Rabbit Hole XP as a "Crypto IQ" to determine how qualified a user is based off their smart-contract interactions.
